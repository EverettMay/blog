# 1
Another birthday by myself (ﾐዋ ﻌ ዋﾐ)ﾉ

I have so much things want to do and shits want to say, but no one will listen so I just speak to computer now.

After so much brutal things and the isolation will I ever be normal again?

This entire week I only eat one piece of bread each day and don't feel hungary at all, and this new med keeps me from sleeping so I haven't slept in two days.

Feel like I'm dying. 

I really want to go see horror movies but no one would come. 

Really nothing is fun when you are by yourself.

I'm not even interested in games anymore. 

The only thing makes me not suffer is coding. 

I will just code without sleep or eat until I die.

I can't even find someone to test my program.

I miss her so much

It was just me and her, we did everything together.

Everything felt so fun when she was around.

I am just writing whatever I come up.

"Don't tell anybody anything, if you do, you start missing everybody"

I never complain and despise whoever complains 

Everything happened was only my fault

I hate to chitchat

I only want to talk about meaningful stuff

Like math, cs, sciences, philosophy, art, nature, death ,heart, lies, memories, fears, and love 

I wonder how these thing feels like 

I just want a good friend who would talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk and talk with me until the end of the day

Well that I guess I am asking too much

Actually just anyone and anything is better than nothing 

I love the labs so much, I would do it 12 hours a day cuz I get to talk to someone, and someone will listen to me. Even its just stupid python problems

I don't want to go home

It's so lonely at home

I would go to events undercover and hiding behind people and eavesdrop their conversation for a little bit of relief.

But my craving is insatiable.

I just want to say something to somebody

I bought food for the homeless last time I went out just so that I can talk to someone

I am so pathetic 

I can't bear this loneliness anymore 

It's just me in this entire universe

Every minute feels like a year

Ok I realized this is getting more and more sad as I go on to think about anything 

Now I dumped some of this feelings through words and I will go back to pretending I am fine
